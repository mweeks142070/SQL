#Here I am querying a database with multiple tables consisiting of thousands of entries to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT Count(orderId)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderId) = 6
AND orderId <> 'Order ID';

#with the where and and clause I am filtering out the nulls

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT Count(orderId)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderId) = 6
AND orderId <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderId
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price) as price_sold
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum) as number_customers, AVG(quantity*price) as avg_price_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust
ON feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity > 2
AND length (orderId) = 6
AND orderId <> 'Order ID';
