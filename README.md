# Madison Weeks' SQL Portfolio

### Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository is a collection of SQL examples that I've written. These examples cover a range of topics, from basic SQL queries to more complex data transformations and analytics. I hope you find something here that is useful. Please feel free to take a look around and don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback at mweeks142070@gmail.com.
