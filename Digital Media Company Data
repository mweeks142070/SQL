#Here I am querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about a digital media company and their customers.

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry;

6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees as emp
JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices as inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

7. Show the Total price of all invoices for each customer, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT SUM(inv.Total) as InvoiceSum, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName as SalesAgentFName, emp.LastName as SalesAgentLName
FROM chinook.employees as emp
JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices as inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
GROUP BY inv.CustomerId;

8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' and '2009-12-31';

9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total) as TotalSales2009
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' and '2009-12-31';

10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks as t
INNER JOIN chinook.invoice_items as inv
ON t.TrackId = inv.TrackId;

11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT artist.Name as Artist, t.Name as Track, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items as inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks as t
ON Inv.TrackId = t.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums as alb
ON alb.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists as artist
ON artist.ArtistId = alb.ArtistId;
